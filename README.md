# Bitcoin Play

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This game shows how new blocks are added to the blockchain in Bitcoin. It gives a pretty good feel for how proof-of-work works.

## How to Play

Select transaction on the left, and then try to add the block. Start by clicking 'Calculate SHA256 hash'. If the calculated hash ends in a '0', you can add the block by clicking 'Add block'. If not, change the nonce and try again.

## Things I'd Like to Improve

- I'd like to make it a multiplayer game. I imagine a classroom teacher could create a private session, and all the students in the class could compete to mine new blocks. The algorithm would automatically adjust its difficulty after a set number of minutes, so students could see that working in practice.
- It could be more obvious how the blockchain is verified, how each block has a 'previous block' hash pointing back at the previous block, thus linking all the blocks, which cannot be tampered with without going through the proof-of-work again for each block.
- Obviously I'd like improve the look of the project (colors, graphics, layout, etc).

## Running locally

You can pull the project and run it as follows.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
